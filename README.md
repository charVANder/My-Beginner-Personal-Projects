# My-Beginner-Personal-Projects
Just some random projects I've enjoyed working on while learning how to code (mostly in Python for now). As I gain more experience I will probably go back and try to fix up/improve a bunch of these, so please keep that in mind!

| Project | Description | Other Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [YouTube to Mp3/Mp4]() | Download YouTube videos as mp3 or mp4 files. You can even download multiple URLs at the same time. | Many plans for efficiency/improvement updates. Still needs `environment.yml` file and README needs to be fixed. |
| [Number Guessing Game]() | Play a number guessing game with the program! Whether your number of guesses is efficient is based on the binary search method. | Mini project while at the Roux Institute at Northeastern (CS5001). Still needs README/etc. |
| [Pokemon Spaceman Game]() | Spaceman/hangman game in which the player has to guess the Pokemon before the spaceman is abducted. | Mini project while at the Roux Institute at Northeastern (CS5001). Plans to update Pokemon list and add graphics. Still needs README/etc. |
| [Cryptography: Caesar Cipher]() | Encrypts and decrypts caesar cipher w/ a brute force method. | Project while at the Roux Institute at Northeastern (CS5002). Still needs README/etc. |
| Cryptography: ? | --- | --- |
| [K-Means Clustering]() | Tutorial and k-means cluster implementation. | Project while at the Roux Institute at Northeastern (DS5020). Many plans to update program efficiency. Still needs README/etc. |
| [Doubly-Linked List]() | Python class DLList for a doubly-linked list data structure. | Mini project while at the Roux Institute at Northeastern (DS5010). |
| [Christmas Tree]() | Nothing big, just generates a Merry Christmas message with a Christmas tree. | Might go back and make something more fancy. |
